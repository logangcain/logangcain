- 👋 Hi, I’m @logangcain
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning and scripting, especially in the area of music creation and automating music composition workflows.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, though I occassionally review Html, Css, and Google scripts 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on music stuff! I'm still a beginner, so I'm still figuring out my goals and how to get there.
